# SafeSQL-Lab Instructor Materials

## ⚠️ INSTRUCTOR ACCESS ONLY ⚠️

This directory contains instructor-only materials for the SafeSQL-Lab educational platform. These files are **NOT** served by the web application and should be kept secure.

## Contents

### `payloads.txt`
Contains example SQL injection payloads for demonstration purposes. These payloads are organized by exercise type and include:

- Basic login injection techniques
- Search parameter injection
- Numeric parameter injection
- Comment form injection
- Boolean-based blind injection
- Time-based blind injection
- Advanced evasion techniques

### `solutions.md`
Comprehensive solutions guide with:

- Detailed explanations of each vulnerability
- Step-by-step exploitation techniques
- Secure implementation examples
- Key learning points for each exercise
- General mitigation strategies
- Detection and monitoring techniques

## Access Control

These materials are intentionally excluded from the web application to prevent unauthorized access. They should only be shared with:

- Authorized instructors
- Security training professionals
- Students in controlled educational environments

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Educational Use Only**: These materials are designed exclusively for educational purposes
2. **Controlled Environment**: Only use in isolated, controlled training environments
3. **Proper Authorization**: Ensure all participants have proper authorization to perform security testing
4. **Responsible Disclosure**: Emphasize the importance of responsible disclosure practices
5. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure all activities comply with applicable laws and regulations

## Security Considerations

- These files contain sensitive information about exploitation techniques
- They should be stored securely and not shared publicly
- Access should be logged and monitored
- Regular review and updates are recommended

## Integration with Training

These materials are designed to complement the SafeSQL-Lab platform:

1. Use the payloads to demonstrate vulnerabilities in controlled environments
2. Reference the solutions guide when explaining concepts to students
3. Encourage students to understand both the attack and defense perspectives
4. Emphasize the importance of secure coding practices

## Updates and Maintenance

- Review and update materials regularly
- Stay current with new attack techniques and mitigation strategies
- Incorporate feedback from training sessions
- Ensure materials remain relevant and accurate

## Contact

For questions about these materials or the SafeSQL-Lab platform, contact the project maintainers through the appropriate channels.
